# Raspberry-Pi-Traffic-Light

## What is a Raspberry Pi device?
A Raspberry Pi device is a small, powerful, and inexpensive single-baord computer (SBC). It enables wireless internet & bluetooth connectivity, HDMI/USB/Audio ports, and other devices found on a typical computer. It is commonly used to teach programming and building hardware projects to home automation, robotics, and can also act as a streamer or web server.

## What can we do with a Raspberry Pi 4 Device?
Using the Raspberry Pi, the options are limitless, for the sake of my final project I decided to do a programmable traffic light robot which carries out the regular functionality of a traffic light- Green, yellow, and red in specific intervals. In addition, like some European traffic lights, I added the feature of a red and yellow static light- this allows drivers and pedestrians to know when the light is about to change. It also has the functionality of a cross-walk feature which signals flashing red and yellow LEDs at a consistent pace, then speeds up at the last three seconds of the countdown timer for crossing. During this countdown and flashing of LEDs, a buzzer feature was also integrated to make pedestrians aware, if not visually, audibly.

The following pieces of apparatus below was used in my robot:

**Physical Apparatus**

1) Raspberry Pi 4
2) Breadboard
3) 3 x 180 ohm resistors
4) 3 x LEDs (Red, Green & Blue)
5) Jumper wires
6) Horn/Buzzer
7) Button

**Coding Environment**

This is built into the Raspberry Pi Board, it comes with a few different programming languages such as C/C++, Javascript, Python (which we used to program our robot), and a couple other languages. The coding environment which was used primarily was built into the Raspberry Pi board called Thonny. All code that is full functional will be associated with a python file named "trafficlight.py" in this repository and can be accessed by anyone.
