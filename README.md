# Raspberry-Pi-Traffic-Light

## What is a Raspberry Pi device?
A Raspberry Pi device is a small, powerful, and inexpensive single-baord computer (SBC). It enables wireless internet & bluetooth connectivity, HDMI/USB/Audio ports, and other devices found on a typical computer. It is commonly used to teach programming and building hardware projects to home automation, robotics, and can also act as a streamer or web server.

## What Can We Do With A Raspberry Pi 4 Device?
The options are limitless, for the sake of my final project I decided to do a programmable traffic light robot which carries out the regular functionality of a traffic light. It also has the functionality of a cross-walk feature which signals flashing red and yellow LEDs at a consistent pace, then speeds up at the last three seconds of the countdown timer for crossing. During this countdown and flashing of LEDs, a buzzer feature was also integrated to make pedestrians aware, if not visually, audibly.
